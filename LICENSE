Additional Terms:

The initial version of this file, to be found at http://qdiabetes.org,
faithfully implements QDiabetes-2018. ClinRisk Ltd. have released this
code under the GNU Affero General Public License to enable others to
implement the algorithm faithfully. However, the nature of the GNU Affero
General Public License is such that we cannot prevent, for example, someone
accidentally altering the coefficients, getting the inputs wrong, or just
poor programming. ClinRisk Ltd. stress, therefore, that it is the
responsibility of the end user to check that the source that they receive
produces the same  results as the original code found at
http://qdiabetes.org. Inaccurate implementations of risk scores can lead to
wrong patients being given the wrong treatment.
