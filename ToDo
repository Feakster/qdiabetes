### Features ###
- Add partial postcode matching to getTDS().
- Add the ability to search by output area to getTDS().
- Incorporate 2001 UK census data into the .dat_oa data frame, and add a "year"
  parameter to getTDS() to all the specification of the Townsend data year.

### Documentation ###
- Add an overall package help file that can be found by executing
  help(QDiabetes).

### Vignettes ###
- Complete the main package vignette.
- Use aggregated GP data in the vignette to simulate a UK population and produce
  a risk map that could be added to the vignette.
- Make a vignette that uses postcode data to produce a map of deprivation in
  inner London.

### Unit Tests ###
- Add tests to check that the input and output vector lengths match for the
  QDR*() functions.
- Alter the assessment of the binary variables to use values likely to produce
  larger risk estimates, e.g. age = 65, bmi = 40, fpg = 6.9, hba1c = 47.9. This
  should make any discrepancies larger.
- Add unit tests that use with(), dplyr and data.table to make sure the package
  works as intended in data frames. A weird error was being thrown before
  because of how gender/pcos/gestdiab were being checked. Need more thoroughness
  here.

### Misc ###
- Edit the README.md file to mention the "surv" parameter of QDiabetes-2013. The
  code allows this to specify modifiable risk periods from 1--15 years. However
  it ceases to be configurable in QDiabetes-2018.
