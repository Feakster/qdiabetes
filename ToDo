- Sort where to put the wording of the Open Government License for the datasets obtained from the Office for National Statistics.
- Sort whether or not the GNU AGPL v3 preamble is required for each source file using materials from ClinRisk's QDiabetes-2018 website, and who's details go in this.
- Harmonise the QDR?() documentation.
- Complete the vignette.
- Use aggegated GP data in the vignette to simulate a UK population & produce a risk map that could be added to the vignette.
- Write unit tests for the vQDRC() functions.
- Vectorise the QDR() function.
- Add tests to check that the input and output vector lengths match for the vQDR*() functions.
- Check Townsend Deprivation Score ranges in all regional layers to find the minimum and maximum possible values.
- Alter the assessment of the binary variables to use values likely to produce larger risk estimates, e.g. age = 65, bmi = 40, fpg = 6.9, hba1c = 47.9. This should make any discrepancies larger.
